## An Agentic AI based Spear Phishing tool using OSINT to generate targeted emails

This is my Plymouth University final‑year BSc Cyber Security degree project. Which proposes a web‑based dashboard that demonstrates how an agentic AI could use publicly available information (OSINT) to craft spear‑phishing e‑mails. The goal is to show the risks of OSINT misuse, not to harm individuals. The system should collect OSINT only with the individual’s consent (via a form for name, e‑mail and birthdate) and store data encrypted at rest.
