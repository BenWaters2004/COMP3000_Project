## Assessing the Dual-Use Potential of Agentic AI in OSINT-Based Targeted Email Generation

The rise of agentic AI-systems capable of autonomous, multi-step reasoning - has amplified the sophistication of social engineering attacks, such as spear-phishing. Which exploit publicly available data via OSINT techniques. Academic researchers, cybersecurity educators, and AI ethics scholars at universities are now challenged with understanding and mitigating the dual-use risks of advanced AI systems in social engineering. Particularly spear-phishing, while lacking scalable, ethical tools to simulate and study such threats. Existing phishing simulation platforms are often manual, lack AI-driven realism, or fail to integrate comprehensive OSINT workflows, limiting their utility for academic study. </br></br>
AIDEN (Agentic Intelligence Dual-use Evaluation Network) is a consent-driven, agentic AI research platform that simulates targeted spear-phishing communications within a controlled environment. Operating as a network of interconnected AI agents, AIDEN automates OSINT data collection from a variety of OSINT tools and sources, validates data accuracy through cross-referencing and ranking algorithms, generates hypothetical phishing emails, and evaluates misuse potential. Users initiate the tool with a mandatory consent form, ensuring ethical compliance, with outputs confined to analytical reports and visualisations to prevent real-world harm. </br></br>
AIDEN enables ethical research by providing a safe environment to study AI-driven social engineering, ensuring simulations are consent-based and harm-free. Its multi-agent architecture enhances scalability, allowing researchers to explore complex OSINT workflows. By analysing misuse risks - such as adversarial exploitation or privacy violations - AIDEN informs policy recommendations and ethical frameworks, supported by safeguards like data encryption, access controls, and audit trails. For educators, AIDEN serves as a teaching tool, enriching cybersecurity and AI ethics curricula with practical insights. For scholars, it facilitates publications and policy briefs on AI governance. By bringing together technical innovation and societal responsibility. AIDEN empowers universities to lead in understanding and mitigating AI’s dual-use challenges, fostering a safer digital world.
